# youtube crawler/spider
In a youtube channel there is a tab called "Channels" where they link to other channels. I use this to find related creators, but I wanted to see how far it goes.
The program uses selenium to scrape the channels, and then the channel channels, till infinity.

# WIP
-[DONE] get the channels on one page

-get all the channels channels till infinity

-visualise it with some graph code
